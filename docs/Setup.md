# Setup  

Refer to [Installation](#) and [Extension](#) for instructions on installing WallWiz and obtaining the required extensions.  

- Launch Kitty with remote control enabled, as this is necessary for fullscreen image previews and terminal auto-scaling to fit all images.  
- Run the command:  
  ```bash  
  WallWiz -d [path to your wallpaper directory]  
  ```  
- WallWiz will scan the wallpapers and extract colors. This process occurs only during the first execution or when a new wallpaper is added to the wallpaper directory.  
- WallWiz will then display the wallpapers in a grid within the terminal, allowing you to select a wallpaper.  
- The selected wallpaper will be applied, along with the corresponding application themes.
