This repo is a curated collection of beautiful, high-quality wallpapers for your devices. 
It's open for contributions, and anyone can add new wallpapers or share their existing wallpaper repositories here.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in two ways:

1. **Upload Your Wallpaper:**
   - Upload your wallpaper images to this repository.
   - The name of each wallpaper should be descriptive and use underscores (`_`) to separate words. This makes it easier to search for wallpapers by name.
   - **Example:** `sunset_over_mountains_skyline.jpg`
   - **If possible, include the artist's name at the end of the wallpaper name.**  
     **Example:** `sunset_over_mountains_skyline_john_doe.jpg`
   
2. **Share Your Wallpaper Repo:**

## Naming Conventions

- **Descriptive Names:** Make sure your wallpaper names are descriptive. This helps others find wallpapers by their content easily.
  - **Bad Example:** `wallpaper1.jpg`
  - **Good Example:** `city_night_lights.jpg`
  
- **Artist Credit (Optional but Preferred):** If you know the artist who created the wallpaper, please append their name to the end of the wallpaper file name.
  - **Example:** `beach_sunset_jane_doe.jpg`
  
- **Undisclosed Artist:** If you don't know the artist, that's okay! You can upload the wallpaper without the artist's name, but if you are the artist, or if you know the artist, please consider crediting them.

## Artist Credits

If you are an artist whose work appears in this repository without your name attached to the wallpaper, **please contact me** so that I can add your name to the credit.

I respect the work of all artists, and it's important that credit is given where it's due. You can reach out to me via [issues](https://github.com/5hubham5ingh/wallwiz/issues) or by creating a pull request with the correct attribution.

## License

Please make sure that the wallpapers you upload are your own work or properly licensed for sharing. If you're using wallpapers from other sources, ensure that you have the right to distribute them. For any wallpapers shared, you must respect the original artist's licensing terms.
